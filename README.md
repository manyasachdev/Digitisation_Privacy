Placeholder for theoretical research paper titled "Wear is the Privacy? - A Comparative Analysis of the Apple Watch and Xiaomi's Mi Band"

Abstract :
Wearable technology is slowly cementing its place in everyday life. Some call it "the closest thing to under the skin sensors". Such a product becomes an extension of the wearer. Thus, it is imperative to make sure that the user is not unknowingly exploited. Through a thorough examining of privacy policies, data collection architecture and consent practices, this paper presents a comparative analysis between two popular solutions for wearable technology in the market, the Apple Watch and Xiaomi’s Mi Band. Investigation into the two products reveals significant differences in the way data is handled and perceived. Apple looks at data as something to be protected. Xiaomi, considers it a free asset. The insights reveal multiple implications in terms of user outlook towards products. By using the Apple watch as a benchmark for approval, we examine and identify gaps in Mi Band’s architecture and offer solutions for improvement.
